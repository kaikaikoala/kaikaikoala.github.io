              I think a latte can truly warm your heart. When I was in highschool, I would often go to the cafe with the neighborhood dads after pickup soccer. Once a guy’s family said they were gonna join us. I helped him carry the extra drinks back to the table, and after I placed the latte on the table he readjusted it just so. When his wife sat down to join us she smiled at the heart facing her just so…

              My wife also likes latte’s, and takes her morning coffee as seriously as I take my morning shit. So, in the last 2 years I have been practicing my latte art at the office so I can hand her a perfectly crafted heart. Now, after watching a few James Hoffman videos: The Best Espresso Machine Under £500, The Best Espresso Grinder Under £500 , we have just sprung for a home setup: DF64 Gen 2 grinder and Breville Bambino Plus espresso machine.
